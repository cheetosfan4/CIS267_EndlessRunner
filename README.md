## GUIDE
### GOAL
Your goal is to RUN to the RIGHT, and to collect as many YUMMYFRUITS as possible!\
Collecting YUMMYFRUITS is a source of POINTS, so try not to miss any if you want to get the HIGH SCORE!\
You can also receive POINTS by banishing CREATURES, and just by RUNNING through the game!

Press Spacebar to JUMP, and press it while sliding against a BRICK WALL to WALL JUMP.\
Press the P key to pause the game.\
Press the H key to activate or deactivate your HOURGLASS.

### OBSTACLES
BRICK WALL: Use your WALL JUMP ability to scale these!\
CREATURE: Jump on a CREATURE's head to banish them! RUNNING into their side costs a HIT POINT!\
SPIKE: Try not to RUN into these! Touching one costs a HIT POINT!\
VOID: Falling into a pit or lagging behind on your RUN will end it INSTANTLY!

### ITEMS
